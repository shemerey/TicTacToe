## Tic Tac Toe
--------------
This repository created for one particular purpose, practise in refactoring and vim
skills, the original repo located here https://github.com/jisaacks/ruby-tic-tac-toe
article about this game you could find here http://www.jisaacks.com/ruby-tutorial-make-a-tic-tac-toe-game

By the way, all commits are meaningful, which means there are no faild commits, and
original behaviour still here. Each commit, is a litle step forward to new code
structure with old behavior
